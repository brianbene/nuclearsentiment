The Science of Nuclear Power | IAEA,"If you would like to learn more about the IAEA’s work, sign up for our weekly updates containing our most important news, multimedia and more. Nuclear energy is a form of energy released from the nucleus, the core of atoms, made up of protons and neutrons. This source of energy can be produced in two ways: fission – when nuclei of atoms split into several parts – or fusion – when nuclei fuse together. The nuclear energy harnessed around the world today to produce electricity is through nuclear f",0.9921

Large doses of ionizing radiation can cause acute illness by reducing the production of blood cells and damaging the digestive tract. A very large dose of ionizing radiation can also damage the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular system), brain, and skin. Radiation injury due to large and very large doses is referred to as a tissue reaction. The dose needed to cause visible tissue injury varies with tissue type.",-0.9999

It takes far more than what you might get from any medical treatment to cause it. Doctors named the illness, which is technically known as acute radiation syndrome, after the atomic bombings that ended World War II. It's not clear how many of the 150,000 to 250,000 people killed in those attacks died from radiation sickness. But estimates at the time put the number in th",-0.998
