Is a nuclear power plant worth it?,261,1710348781.0,"I just started playing about 3 weeks ago and just unlocked the nuclear power plant. So far my factory has been running on solar panels and accumulators and it’s not really enough and I was wondering is nuclear the way to go? How much do I have to worry about it blowing up? How effective is it compared to just adding solar panels or coal steam engines? And if it’s really that good what are some things I need to know before setting the whole thing up?
Thanks",factorio
Is the nuclear power plant really woth the hassle? ,3,1727726635.0,"Are they worth all that effort? I mean sure, one of them are woth like 10 fuel powered generators. But 10 of those would be easier to sustain than one nuclear power plant. Unless you guys know a good place for it?

On that note, should I use the interactive map on my first playthrough? I guess it would be making the game a lot easier, especially for these situations, but should I?",SatisfactoryGame
